<h5>This platform is mostly for testing purpose of apps&scripts I work on, objective is to learn to build applications from end to end using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, object-relational mapping, model-view-controller architecture patterns and other concepts</h5>
</br>
<h5> The main app I work now is <a href="{{ url_for('stocks') }}">Oligarh game</a> , buy and sell real stocks, play casino (roulette- this one I like the most :)), bet on sports and compete with other players. More about the game you can find on <a href="{{ url_for('about') }}">About page</a> After will finish with bugs,cleaning and design will deploy it separately on Heorku most probably</h5>
<h5>Main activities and challenges for now:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Prettifying data from iexfinance API , adding some functions for that, data is also incomplete, for some stocks the dividend date/pay are missing. </li>
    <li>Changing front-end things to more interactive with javascript and jQuery </li>
    <li>Charts, building some functions to represent the data in Plotly</li>
    <li>Organizing the app, since beginning of my study Iâ€™ve been building everything in one python file :), now cleaning, arranging functions and apps in files,  commenting , trying to make the work readable, because in some places even I have to understand what I've wrote in past :)</li>
    <li>Front end,  CSS</li>
    <li>Implementing bet system (roulette done)</li>
    <li>Automated trading</li>
    <li>Newsreader and sentiment signaling bot using NLP</li>
    <li>Change the front to React, need some more time to study. For now javascript and jQuery is fine</li>
    <li></li>

</ul>
